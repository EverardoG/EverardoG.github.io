<!-- ### Personal Statement -->

I am a Robotics PhD student at Oregon State University researching multi-agent systems in Professor Kagan Tumer's lab. My current research interests include decentralized multi-agent coordination and multi-agent learning. I am also interested in finding applications of robotics that can help us better understand or even combat climate change, especially as it pertains to our oceans. My background includes hands-on robotics system prototyping and robotics software development. Alongside my technical research, I seek to contribute to diversity, equity, and inclusion within and outside of engineering.
