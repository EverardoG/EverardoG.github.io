# Flippy the Hopper
This is the story of how my life got flipped turned upside down... all for an adorable little hopper.

## The Dawn of Design Nature
For my introductory design class, Design Nature, I was tasked with building some sort of bio-inspired "hopper" from a preset kit of parts. Along with these constraints, I had to set my own individual design goal for my hopper. I didn't want to do anything wouldn't appeal to me, so after some time, I decided on a goal that I thought would suite me well:

"I will engage my classmates by building a hopper that attempts to hop over an obstacle to create a moment of suspense, where it is unclear whether or not the hopper will make it over the obstacle."

## So many Sketches
It wasn't until this class that I really began to understand the power of sketching, whether it be quick off the cuff napkin sketches, or well detailed, film production worthy masterpieces. I started ideating what this hopper would look like with quick motion sketches that quickly became more detailed ideas that might be worth trying to build. My personal favorite was the corgi hopper sketch because it sounded so cool. My sketches are shown below:

## Time to Bring Some Sketches to Life
At this point, I had some sketches for potential hopper ideas. The next step was to turn some of these sketches into sketch models, a cardboard representation of what some of these hoppers could look like.

I found this very valuable as I quickly realized that some of my sketches were a bit too complicated to bring to life for this project. I knew I would need to keep my designs simple moving forward.

## Design Goal Revisited
After spending some time iterating through sketches and models, I was given the opportunity to revise and finalize my design goal. By this time, I had noticed that I wasn't really interested in the suspense that I could create with a small hopper. What I was really interested in was making something fun and adorable. This was my new design goal:

"I will engage my friends from home by building an adorable hopper that hops a very short distance, and hops pathetically in order to make them laugh."

In my new design goal, I outlined what I thought would make my hopper look very "derpy" both before, during, and after a hop. I thought it would be really funny to build something "derpy" that hopped pathetically to a smattering of auplause. In the case of showing the hopper to my friends from home, I would be the one suypplying the smattering of applause.

## Time for Testing
I had collected all this valuable information on how I could design my hopper, and none of it quite pointed me in the "right" direction. My sketches depicted some overly complex hoppers, and my models failed to do much except sit there. It was time to see if I could make something actually hop. I decided to experiment with some springs and springy wire to see if I could use them as actuators for my hopper. I also decided to test the feasiblity of triggering the hopper using a capacitor against using a suction cup.

I found that the springy wire and suction cup were my best bets if I wanted a successful hopper. Not only did they work, their current placement made the hopper perform flips as it hopped. I decided that was how I would make my hopper derpy.

## Prototype Power
The deadline for the final hopper was coming soon, and both my benchtop test models used materials that weren't allowed on the final hopper. I took what I learned from the benchtop tests and created something closer to the final hopper.

</p>

This iteration hopped, and it was definitely pathetic when it did so. However, it just was not cute enough for me to consider my design goal having been met.

## Final Product: Flippy
I focused the stretch of time before the hopper's final demo on making my hopper as cute as could possibly be. I thought my hopper already looked a bit like a mouse, so I decided to play off of that aesthetic. I tried several ear sizes, and different tail materials until I had my final product: Flippy.

Flippy performed beautifully when the time came for final demos. He hopped a whopping two inches off the demo table, flipped on his back, and then promptly fell on the floor.
