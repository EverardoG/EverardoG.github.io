Right now I'm essentially using this place to document some things from summer research so I don't have to keep going back to Youtube tutorials to figure things out again.

## Welcome to Simulated Quadcopter Visual Odometry!
My goal is to make it possible to easily set up a gazebo simulation of the ar drone where you can utilize some of the principles taught in the visual odometry course taught by Jurgen Sturm at the University of Munich. The [wiki](placeholder.html) will include all of the documentation for getting lots of things set up.
