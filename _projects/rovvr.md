## About 

**Olin Collaborators:** Amy Phung, Cameron Wierzbanowski, Erika Lu, Nathan Shuster, w. Advisor Lynn Andrea Stein

**MBARI Collaborators:** Eric J. Martin, Benjamin Erwin, Kakani Katija, Steven H.D. Haddock

**Timeline:** Year-long Senior Capstone Project

The goal of this project was to prototype a Virtual-Reality (VR) based control room for underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) as a potential upgrade to conventional ROV control rooms. I worked on this project as a senior at Olin College with four other senior students and a faculty advisor. We also collaborated directly with a team of pilots, scientists, and engineers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Insititute (MBARI) to better understand the needs of our prototype's end users. We tested our software with MBARI's MiniROV in their one million liter saltwater test tank facility to create a final prototype capable of displaying real-time stereo-camera footage and telemetry data.

This project has been included in two academic papers: **"A Virtual Reality Video System for Deep Ocean Remotely Operated Vehicles"** in IEEE OCEANS 2021, and **"Catching Jellies in Immersive Virtual Reality: A Comparative Teleoperation Study of ROVs in Underwater Capture Tasks"** in VRST 2021. The first paper details the integration of the virtual reality control room with MBARI's custom 4k stereo-camera designed specifically for operation on an ROV at extreme depths. The second discusses the results of a user study with ROV pilots that compared the effectiveness of the VR control room to a conventional control room. When pilots used the VR control room as opposed to the conventional control room, they cut their task completion time in *half*, suggesting this technology is promising for the future of ROV piloting.

 conventional ROV control room

This project was a joint collaboration 

This project was a year long senior capstone project I worked on with four other seniors, an advisor, and

- developing a virtual reality based control room for Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)
- transitioning ROV control room displays from fixed monitors to VR overlays
- live stereo footage creates the illusion of actually being the ROV, perceiving depth
- customizable UI - monitors in control room are large and bulky, can't actually be moved around -->
